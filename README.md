# Project Background
One of my modules for Year 2 is **Data Engineering (aka DENG)** where I had to **design 3 databases from scratch over 2 months** based on a given problem statement...

## Problem Statement
Classic Cars Pte Ltd is a retailer of toys specializing in scale car models. Currently, they are using an **OLTP** system in their day-to-day operations and recently, the CEO has decided to setup a data warehouse for analysis purpose, and he wants you to **design a star/snowflake schema, setup the OLTP database and create a data warehouse that can generate meaningful insights in the areas of Sales, Staff/Offices, Seasons of Sales and Orders/Customer**.

## Database Features

It consistsof 8 tables: 
- Offices
- Employees
- Orders
- Order Details
- Payments
- Products
- Product Lines
- Customers

## Project Setup
1. Download the zipped files and open them in `Microsoft SQL Server`.

2. Click on **Connect** and **right click on Databases** to create a **new schema** called `FairPrice`.

3. **Double click on** `CarSales` to make it the working database and run the SQL statements by clicking on **Execute**.

### Other Notes
